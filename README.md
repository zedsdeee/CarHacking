#  Car Hacking Studies

Back on 20250302 I was in Japan attending SECCON13 and exploring the interesting event areas.

While walking around, I came across a Car Hacking Village. My first thought was, â€œWhat exactly are they hacking in cars, anyway?"

The staff handed me a small CANBUS kit used for their car hacking CTF. At that point, I had no prior knowledge of automotives, so I had to do due diligence to understand the basics before CTF.

The concept immediately caught my attention. The idea that vehicles could be vulnerable to digital exploitation was just you know fascinating. 

That encounter 'motorvated' me to dive deeper into the world of car hacking kinda stuff.
